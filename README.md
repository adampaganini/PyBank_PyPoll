### PyBank_PyPoll

Here I present two database analyses: PyBank and PyPoll

### PyBank

The "PyBank" analysis is a financial analysis to determine outcomes of a data set titled "budget_data.csv".
The data set has 2 columns ("Date" and "Profits/Losses") that will allow us to calculate the following outcomes using the Python scripted titled "PyBank-main-calc-script.py":

a) Total Months
b) Total sum of money traded
c) Average Change in profit/loss
d) Greatest Increase in Profits
and d) Greatest Decrease in Profits

The output for this data is in a file titled "PyBank-output.txt"

### PyPoll

The "PyPoll" analysis is an election data analysis to determine outcomes of a data set titled "election_data.csv".
The data set has 3 columns ("Ballot ID", "County", & "Candidate") that will allow us to calculate the following election results using the Python scripted titled "PyPoll-main-calc-script.py":

a) total votes in the election
b) how many votes each of the 3 candidates received
c) the percentage of votes each of the 3 candidates received
and d) the name of the winning candidate with the largest vote-share

The output for this data is in a file titled "PyPoll-output.txt"
